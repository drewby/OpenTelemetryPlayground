# OpenTelemetry Playground

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Using the Tools](#using-the-tools)
* [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
* [More Documentation](./docs/README.md)

The purpose of this project is to explore the OpenTelemetry Specification and SDKs. Currently the project has working code using the [Javascript](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js) and [.NET](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-dotnet) OpenTelemetry libraries.  

The cluster includes two API applications, a frontend SPA web application (`todospa`) and a backend webapi (`todoapi`). The scenario is a classic Todo application where a user can add, delete, complete and list simple Todos. 

Incoming API requests (anything to /api) go through a Nginx ingress service on port 8080 which are forwarded to the ingress-nginx-dapr sidecar which then sends requests to the backend `todoapi` service.

Additionally, the cluster includes the following monitoring services:

* **Grafana**: a platform for analyzing and visualizing metrics and logs
* **Loki**: a log aggregation system
* **Prometheus**: a monitoring and alerting system
* **Jaeger**: a distributed tracing system

## Goals

The goals of this project are as follows:

* Explore OpenTelemetry DotNet implementation for Logs, Metrics, and Traces.
* Create extensions to enhance the API and/or SDK for .NET.
* Implement a sampling strategy using the OpenTelemetry Collector.

## Documentation

[Additional Documentation is Here](./docs/README.md)

## Getting Started

Here's how you can get started with this project. 

1. Follow one of the options below to create a Dev Container [on your local machine](#local-development) or as a [GitHub CodeSpace](#github-codespaces). 
2. It will take several minutes for container to launch and the [on-create.sh](.devcontainer/on-create.sh) script to run.
3. Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

**IMPORTANT**: The URL must use *http://localhost* so nginx recognizes the host. Using http://127.0.0.1 will not work.

### Local development

1. Clone the repository: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cse-labs/otel
```

2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Select the toast to *Reopen in Container*

<img src="./docs/images/reopen-in-container.png" alt="Reopen in container dialogue" title="Open in Container" width=300 style="margin-left: 40px;">


4. If the toast didn't appear, open the command pallete (**Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P**) and select *Dev Containers: Reopen in Container*
5. The first time you open the folder in a container, it may take a few minutes to create the container.

### Github Codespaces

1. Open the repository on Github.com (https://github.com/cse-labs/otel)
2. Above the code listing, click *Code*.
3. Click *Codespaces*.
4. Click  *Create codespace on main*.

5. It will take a few minutes to create the container.

    *Eventually Visual Studio Code will launch inside your browser. However, you will want to connect from a local instance of Visual Studio Code to access the cluster via **localhost**.*

6. Click the word *Codespaces* in the bottom left corner of the screen and select *Open in VS Code Desktop* from the drop-down.

## Using the Tools

The following tools are included in the project for development and cluster management:

* **k9s**: A terminal-based UI to manage Kubernetes clusters.
* **kubectl**: A command-line tool for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster. 
* **curl**: A command-line tool for making HTTP requests. 
* **Grafana** (available at http://localhost:30000): Monitoring dashboards
* **Jaeger** (available at http://localhost:30001): Distributed traces
* **Static Website** (available at http://localhost:8080/): This is a web server pointed at the files in `src/todospa`

Grafana is connected to the datasources Prometheus, Loki, and Jaeger.

In addition to the above tools, the project also includes a `Makefile` for easier development. The `Makefile` contains the following commands:

* **make build-(ops|todoapi|todospa)**: Builds the ops, todoapi, or todospa component
* **make deploy-todaapi**: Deploys the todoapi component to the cluster
* **make all-todoapi**: Runs both *build* and *deploy*
* **make all**: Runs both *all-todoapi* and  *build-todospa* to build and deploy changes to both the frontend and backend components
* **make test-todoapi**: Runs tests for todoapi
* **make test-jsonconsoleexporter**: Runs tests for OpenTelemetry.Exporter.JsonConsole.Tests
* **make test**: Runs tests for all projects a produces coverage report in `coverage` folder
